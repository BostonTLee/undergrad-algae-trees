Miles Austin, Dawson Eliasen, Boston Lee  
December 2020

To recreate the project, take the following steps:

1. Create a virtual environment called `venv`: 

   ```
   python3 -m virtualenv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
1. Install the requirements from the requirements file:

   ```
   pip install -m requirements.txt
   ```
1. Run the prediction experiments, with `python3 main.py`. 
1. Knit `paper.Rmd` and/or `slides.Rmd` with `knitr`.

To generate the figures separately from the `.Rmd` documents, run `python3
plots.py`.
